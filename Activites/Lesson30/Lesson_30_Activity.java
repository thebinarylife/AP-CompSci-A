/*
 * Lesson 30 Coding Activity 
 * Due to a problem with a scanner an array of words was created 
 * with spaces in incorrect places. Write the code to process the 
 * list of words and trim any spaces out of the words.
 *
 * So if the list contains:
 *      {"every", " near ing ", " checking", "food ", "stand", "value "}
 *
 * It should be changed to hold:        
 *      {"every", "nearing", "checking", "food", "stand", "value"}
 *         
 * Note that this activity does not require you to print anything. 
 * Your code should end with the array list still declared and
 * containing the resulting words.
 *
